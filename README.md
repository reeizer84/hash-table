# HashTable
A C++ implementation of the hash table
### How to run a program?
Firstly, compile a hashtable.cpp file. Now having a .exe file, you can run it your terminal and manage the hash table. A hash table can be managed by commands. You can enter them directly into the terminal or prepare a .txt file with all needed commands, then redirect it to input. 
  
**Important! Each input must start with a number of tables you intend to create (you can create multiple tables in one run). If you want to switch to managing another table, just enter stop. An example input is included.**
### What are the possible commands?
size n - set the table size to n
add k s - add an object with key k and string s to the table
delete k - remove the object with key k
print - display the content of the table (only filled cells are shown); each row has: index of the object in the table, it's key and string
stop - end of case
