# HashTable
A C++ implementation of the hash table
### How to run a program?
Firstly, compile the hashtable.cpp file. A hash table can be managed by the commands. You can enter them directly into the terminal or prepare a .txt file with all needed commands, then redirect it to the input. 
  
**Important! Each input must start with a number of the tables you intend to create (you can create multiple tables in one run). If you want to switch to managing another table, just enter stop. An example input is included.**
### What are the possible commands?
size n - set the table size to n  
add k s - add an object with the key k and the string s to a table  
delete k - remove the object with the key k  
print - display the content of the table (only filled cells are shown); each row has: an index of an object in the table, it's key and string  
stop - end of editing the current table
